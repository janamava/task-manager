<p>Hi there, </p>

<p>this is a task manager application, that I created as a final project for the specialization phase in New Austrian
    Coding School.
</p>

<p>
    It helped me to put in practice the knowledge I was taught at school and served as a
    great introduction to the basic concepts of Angular and Node.js, both in terms of size and
    complexity.
</p>

<p>
    Thanks for taking time and looking at my humble creation!
